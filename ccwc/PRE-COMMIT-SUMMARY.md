# Pre-commit Setup Summary

✅ **Successfully added pre-commit to your Go project!**

## What was installed:

### 1. Pre-commit Configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- **General hooks**: trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer, YAML validation, etc.
- **Go-specific hooks**:
  - `go-fmt-check`: Ensures code is properly formatted
  - `go-imports`: Organizes imports
  - `go-vet`: Static analysis
  - `go-test`: Runs all tests
  - `go-mod-tidy`: Keeps module dependencies clean

### 2. Makefile Integration
New pre-commit targets added:
- `make pre-commit-install`: Install hooks
- `make pre-commit-run`: Run hooks on all files
- `make pre-commit-update`: Update hook versions
- `make setup-precommit`: Automated setup script

### 3. Git Hooks Installed
Pre-commit hooks are now installed and will run automatically on every `git commit`.

## Current Status:
- ✅ All hooks passing
- ✅ 100% test coverage maintained
- ✅ Code automatically formatted and checked
- ✅ Git hooks active

## Usage:

### Automatic (Recommended):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
# Hooks run automatically before commit
```

### Manual:
```bash
make pre-commit-run          # Run all hooks
pre-commit run --all-files   # Same as above
```

### Skip hooks (emergency only):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency commit"
```

## What happens on commit:
1. **Trailing whitespace** is removed
2. **Files are ensured to end with newline**
3. **Go code is checked for formatting**
4. **Imports are organized**
5. **`go vet` runs** for static analysis
6. **All tests run** (your 100% coverage is verified!)
7. **`go mod tidy`** keeps dependencies clean

If any hook fails, the commit is blocked until issues are fixed.

## Next steps:
- Try making a commit to see the hooks in action
- Use `make help` to see all available targets
- Run `make ci` for the full CI pipeline
